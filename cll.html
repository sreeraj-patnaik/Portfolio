      <p>The Candle’s Last Light</p>
<p>- D S R Patnaik</p>
<p>“Anna... Anna—this way, dear!” The young yet</p>
<p>commanding voice of Sister Rosemary rang out, carrying both tenderness and authority. With practiced ease, she guided Anna’s wheelchair to a better spot, turning it slightly so the girl could take in the stunning view. The cool mountain breeze tousled Anna’s chestnut hair, and her wide brown eyes sparkled as she gazed at the scene before her.</p>
<p>The vacation spot was nothing short of magical. Towering mountains wrapped in silvery cloaks of mist stretched endlessly, their peaks kissed by the heavens. Wildflowers in every imaginable hue blanketed the slopes, as if nature had spilled its palette over the landscape. It felt as though the world had paused to give these children, so accustomed to the gray walls of the orphanage, a glimpse of untouched paradise.</p>
<p>“Look, Sister Rosemary,” Anna whispered, her voice soft with wonder. “The clouds are sitting on the flowers!”</p>
<p>Sister Rosemary chuckled, resting a gentle hand on Anna’s shoulder. “It does seem that way, doesn’t it? God’s handiwork is extraordinary, my dear.”</p>
<p>Before Anna could reply, a loud and impatient voice shattered the moment. “Get off my way, Anna! I’m walking!” Frank’s words were sharp and grating, carrying the unmistakable rudeness of a boy used to pushing boundaries.</p>
<p>Startled, Anna instinctively pulled her hands into her lap as Frank brushed past, his face set in a defiant scowl.</p>
<p>“Frank! That is enough!” Sister Rosemary’s voice snapped like a whip. Her usual calm was replaced with a steely edge. “Do you think Father would approve of you behaving like this?”</p>
<p>Frank froze mid-step, a flicker of guilt flashing across his face. “I’m... I’m sorry, Sister Rosemary,” he muttered, though his tone was far from sincere. His mischievous grin returned almost immediately as his eyes darted to Anna’s wheelchair, a glint of arrogance still lingering.</p>
<p>“Sorry isn’t a word you toss around, Frank. It’s something you mean,” Sister Rosemary said, her gaze fixed firmly on him. “Now behave yourself, or there will be consequences.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Sister,” Frank mumbled, looking away as he kicked at a patch of grass.</p>
<p>“Now, all of you,” Sister Rosemary addressed the group, her voice once again calm but commanding, “head into the house. Mr. Yates has been waiting to meet you.”</p>
<p>The children, their ages ranging from ten to eleven, scattered like birds, racing across the expansive lawn toward the house. The structure loomed ahead—a weathered but proud two-story wooden building. Its paint had faded with time, but the intricate carvings</p>
<p>on the shutters and the grand arch over the door spoke of a past filled with care and craftsmanship. Surrounding the house was an enormous garden, wild and overgrown in parts, but bursting with colors and scents that seemed to echo the mountains’ beauty.</p>
<p>As the children crowded near the heavy oak door, their excitement was palpable. Whispers passed between them, speculating about the mysterious Mr. Yates.</p>
<p>“Do you think he’s scary?” one boy asked, his eyes wide.</p>
<p>“Scary? Nah,” another replied. “He probably just wants to tell us boring rules.”</p>
<p>“Quiet down, all of you!” Sister Rosemary said, sweeping past them and placing a hand on the door’s iron handle. “Whatever Mr. Yates has to say, you’ll listen respectfully. Now, inside.”</p>
<p>The door creaked open, revealing a dimly lit hallway with polished wooden floors and walls lined with faded portraits. The air smelled faintly of lavender and something older, like time itself had left its mark on the place.</p>
<p>Anna craned her neck to look inside, her curiosity piqued. “Sister, who is Mr. Yates?” she asked softly.</p>
<p>“You’ll see soon enough, Anna,” Sister Rosemary said with a small smile, her tone carrying a hint of mystery. “Now, let’s not keep him waiting. He must be an interesting man to meet.”</p>
<p>Inside the old house, the children gathered in the living room, their chatter fading as they noticed the man standing by the fireplace. Mr. Yates, tall and wiry, looked at them with a furrowed brow and a slight</p>
<p>sneer tugging at his weathered face. His coat hung heavily from his shoulders, and his boots, still damp with mud, left faint marks on the wooden floor.</p>
<p>“Finally,” he muttered, his tone sharp. “You’re all here. Took long enough.”</p>
<p>Sister Rosemary stepped forward, her serene expression barely faltering. “Children, this is Mr. Yates. He’s kindly offered to share some important advice about staying safe in St. Hallow’s Valley.”</p>
<p>“Kindly?” Yates barked a laugh. “I wouldn’t say kindly, Sister. I’m doing this because someone has to. These kids need to understand the rules, or they’ll end up like the others.”</p>
<p>The children exchanged uneasy glances, their excitement quickly dampened by the man’s gruff demeanor.</p>
<p>“What others?” Frank asked, his usual bravado tempered by nervous curiosity.</p>
<p>Yates shot him a sharp look. “The ones who didn’t listen,” he snapped. “The ones who thought they were smarter than the fog.” He pointed toward the window, where the mist swirled thickly outside. “That stuff out there? It’s not just fog. It’s alive, in its own way. And it doesn’t like intruders.”</p>
<p>Anna shifted uncomfortably in her wheelchair, her small hands gripping the armrests. “What does it do?” she asked softly.</p>
<p>Yates sighed heavily, as if he found the question tiresome. “What does it do?” he repeated, shaking his head. “It tricks you, that’s what. Changes how it looks, how it feels. The fog is not the same always. Often, it</p>
<p>gets heavier, thicker. Makes it hard to breathe. And then come the sounds.”</p>
<p>“Sounds?” Sister Rosemary prompted, her tone calm but firm.</p>
<p>“Yes, sounds,” Yates said curtly, his tone sharp as he gestured with impatience. “Voices whispering your name. Laughter from no one you know. Sometimes it’s cries, desperate and pleading. Other times, it’s worse—it’s your loved ones. And then, when it really wants to mess with you, it’s your own voice. Mocking, calling, begging. The trick is, you won’t even realize it’s you until it’s too late.” He shot Frank a cold, piercing glare as the boy opened his mouth to speak. “And before you even think about asking, no—you don’t follow them. Not ever. Do I make myself clear?” Frank closed his mouth, sinking back into the group.</p>
<p>“But why—” Anna started.</p>
<p>“Why, why, why,” Yates interrupted, rolling his eyes. “Because those who do don’t come back. That fog is a door, a trap, a—” He waved his hand as if dismissing the need to explain further. “Doesn’t matter what it is. What matters is you stay out of it.”</p>
<p>The room grew quiet, the only sound the faint crackle of the fire in the hearth.</p>
<p>“But there’s one thing more important than anything else,” Yates continued, his tone sharp. He jabbed a finger toward the small altar where a candle burned before a crucifix. “That candle? It stays lit. No excuses, no exceptions. You see it going out, you relight it. Got it?”</p>
<p>“What happens if it goes out?” Anna asked, her voice small but steady.</p>
<p>Yates shot her a dark look. “You don’t want to know,” he snapped. “Let’s just say it won’t be me coming to find you.”</p>
<p>The children huddled closer together, their eyes fixed on the flickering flame of the candle. Even Sister Rosemary seemed uneasy, though she quickly masked it with a reassuring smile for the children.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Mr. Yates,” she said, her voice smooth and composed. “We’ll make sure to follow your advice.”</p>
<p>Yates grunted, clearly unconvinced. “You’d better,” he muttered, turning away and pacing toward the window. He peered out at the swirling fog, his shoulders tense. “Because once it starts, there’s no stopping it.”</p>
<p>A sudden gust rattled the windows, and the flame of the candle flickered. Yates turned sharply, his expression a mix of irritation and unease. “Keep that thing steady,” he barked, pointing at the candle. “I’m not repeating myself.”</p>
<p>Here’s the expanded scene, including the introduction of Daisy, some room exploration, and scene descriptions:</p>
<p>Yates glanced around the room, his impatience barely contained. “Daisy!” he bellowed, his voice echoing through the house.</p>
<p>A young maid appeared in the doorway moments later, clutching a stack of folded linens. Her apron was neatly tied, though her slightly disheveled hair and rosy cheeks betrayed how hurriedly she’d come. She looked to be no older than nineteen, her wide brown eyes darting nervously between Yates and the children.</p>
<p>“Yes, Mr. Yates?” she asked, her voice soft but steady.</p>
<p>“Show these brats their rooms,” he said, waving a dismissive hand at the children. “Make sure they don’t touch anything they shouldn’t.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir,” Daisy replied, nodding quickly. She turned to the group with a gentle smile. “Follow me, children. Let’s get you all settled.”</p>
<p>The children hesitated, glancing at Sister Rosemary for reassurance. She nodded warmly. “Go on, children. Daisy will take care of you.”</p>
<p>Reluctantly, the group trailed after Daisy as she led them up the creaking wooden staircase. The house groaned with every step, the sound amplified in the stillness. The walls were lined with faded floral wallpaper, its edges curling with age. A faint smell of lavender lingered in the air, mingling with the scent of old wood.</p>
<p>“This house is huge!” Frank exclaimed, his earlier bravado returning as he craned his neck to look at the high ceilings.</p>
<p>Daisy chuckled softly. “It is, isn’t it? It’s been here for over a hundred years. Used to be a boarding house for travelers back in the day.”</p>
<p>Anna, sitting quietly in her wheelchair, gazed at the portraits lining the walls. They depicted stern-faced men and women, their painted eyes seeming to follow the children as they moved. “Who are they?” she asked.</p>
<p>“The original owners,” Daisy explained, glancing back. “The Halloway family. They built this house. Some say their spirits still watch over it.”</p>
<p>Frank snorted. “Spirits? Please.”</p>
<p>Daisy’s smile faltered slightly. “Well, some things are better left unspoken,” she said, her tone quiet.</p>
<p>The group reached the second floor, where a long hallway stretched before them, dimly lit by a single flickering bulb. Daisy pointed to the rooms on either side. “The boys will be in these two rooms,” she said, then gestured further down. “And the girls are over here. The bathroom is at the end of the hall. And Anna-Frank, I’m afraid you both need to occupy that room across the corridor as there is no space left. No worries, we will be on our toes once in a while to look after you.”</p>
<p>The children began exploring their assigned rooms. Each was modestly furnished with twin beds, a small wardrobe, and a single window overlooking the fog- drenched garden. The bedding was clean but plain, the quilts handmade and slightly faded.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Daisy moved between the rooms, checking that everyone was settled. Her voice carried through the hallway, offering gentle reassurances and reminders not to stray too far.</p>
<p>“Dinner will be ready in an hour,” she called out. “Until then, stay inside and unpack. And remember, don’t touch the candle downstairs.”</p>
<p>As the children explored their new surroundings, the faint sound of the wind whistling outside grew louder. Shadows danced on the walls, cast by the flickering bulb above. The house seemed to exhale, its old frame shifting and settling, as if it, too, was alive and listening.</p>
<p>Frank peered out into the hallway, his curiosity getting the better of him. “I’m gonna check out what’s in the attic,” he whispered to a boy sharing his room.</p>
<p>“Don’t!” the boy hissed. “Mr. Yates will yell at you.”</p>
<p>Frank grinned mischievously. “What he doesn’t know won’t hurt him.”</p>
<p>Frank was halfway across the hallway, tiptoeing towards the attic door, when a deep, gravelly voice broke the silence.</p>
<p>“And what if I knew?” Yates’s words slithered out from the shadows, startling Frank. The old man stepped forward, his piercing eyes fixed on the boy. “Do you think this house doesn’t talk to me, boy?”</p>
<p>Frank froze, his bravado crumbling. “I-I wasn’t doing anything,” he stammered, retreating a step.</p>
<p>Yates raised an eyebrow, the corner of his mouth twitching in something that might have been a smirk—or a sneer. “Curiosity killed the cat, young man. And in this house, curiosity doesn’t just kill—it consumes.”</p>
<p>The other children, drawn by the commotion, peeked out from their rooms. Daisy rushed up the stairs, her face pale. “Mr. Yates,” she said softly, trying to diffuse the tension. “Perhaps we should let the children settle in without... alarming them.”</p>
<p>Yates snorted but backed away. “Keep him in line, Daisy. And all of you,” he said, his voice rising as his eyes swept over the children, “stay where you’re supposed to. This house doesn’t like trespassers.”</p>
<p>With that, he turned and descended the stairs, his boots echoing ominously. Frank let out a shaky breath, muttering, “What’s his problem?”</p>
<p>Daisy crouched down beside him, her tone firm but kind. “You’d do well to listen, Frank. The attic isn’t a place for games. Now, come along.</p>
<hr>
<p>The dining room was dimly lit, the flickering chandelier above casting long, uneven shadows over the room. A cold draft whispered through the cracks in the old wooden walls, making the flames of the candles tremble. The long wooden table was lined with mismatched plates, steaming bowls of stew, and loaves of freshly baked bread that filled the air with their comforting aroma.</p>
<p>The children filed in hesitantly, their earlier excitement replaced by a tentative quiet. Sister Rosemary gently guided Anna to her place near the head of the table, adjusting her wheelchair to make her comfortable. “There you go, dear,” she said softly, placing a napkin on Anna’s lap.</p>
<p>Frank, as always, made his entrance with a loud scrape of his chair against the floor. He slumped into it with exaggerated ease, earning a sharp glance from Sister Rosemary. “Sit properly, Frank. Show some respect,” she said sternly.</p>
<p>Daisy, the young maid, bustled around the room with practiced efficiency. She poured water into glasses, her hands moving deftly as she hummed a quiet tune under her breath. “Make sure you eat well, everyone,” she said warmly, her voice carrying a note of cheer that felt at odds with the tense air lingering in the room.</p>
<p>Yates entered last, his heavy boots echoing on the wooden floor. He moved with an air of impatience, his sharp gaze sweeping over the table before he settled into the seat at the head. “Eat up,” he said curtly, gesturing at the food. “You’ll need your strength.”</p>
<p>Frank paused mid-bite, curiosity flickering in his eyes. “For what?”</p>
<p>Yates’s face darkened, and he leaned forward, resting his elbows on the table. “For the fog,” he said simply, his voice low and heavy.</p>
<p>The room went silent, the weight of his words settling like a thick blanket over the children. Even Daisy paused, her hand hovering over the breadbasket.</p>
<p>“The fog?” Anna asked hesitantly, her voice barely above a whisper. Her wide eyes turned to Sister Rosemary for reassurance.</p>
<p>Sister Rosemary opened her mouth to respond, but Yates cut her off. “Not all fog is the same, girl. Sometimes it’s just mist and cold air. But other times... it’s something else.”</p>
<p>Frank’s curiosity sparked again. “What kind of something else?” he asked, his tone defiant, though his fidgeting hands betrayed him.</p>
<p>Yates fixed him with a sharp glare, and for a moment, the boy shrank under the weight of his stare. “The kind that calls to you. Whispers your name. Promises things.” His voice dropped, each word deliberate. “But you must never follow it. Ever.”</p>
<p>The wind outside howled as if to punctuate his warning. The children shuddered involuntarily, their eyes darting to the windows where the fog pressed close, its tendrils swirling against the glass.</p>
<p>“And the candle?” Anna asked quietly.</p>
<p>Yates nodded grimly. “The candle before the Lord must never go out. As long as it burns, the house is safe.”</p>
<p>Frank swallowed hard, his earlier bravado slipping away. “What happens if it goes out?”</p>
<p>“I won’t be here tonight, I’m afraid,” Yates said abruptly, ignoring Frank’s question. His tone was clipped, almost irritated. He stood suddenly, pushing his chair back with a screech. “Daisy will look after you lot.”</p>
<p>The maid looked up, startled. “But, Mr. Yates—”</p>
<p>“Just do as you’re told, Daisy,” he snapped. “I’ve business in the village.”</p>
<p>He turned to Sister Rosemary, his expression softening just slightly. “Keep them inside, Sister. No matter what.” Without waiting for her response, he strode out of the room, his boots echoing down the hallway.</p>
<p>The children exchanged uneasy glances. The warmth of the stew and bread seemed to pale in comparison to the cold fear creeping into their hearts.</p>
<p>Daisy, attempting to lighten the mood, clapped her hands together. “Well, that was... dramatic. Let’s focus on finishing up and getting some rest, eh?”</p>
<p>Sister Rosemary nodded firmly, regaining her composure. “Daisy is right. Let’s not dwell on such things. Tomorrow is a new day.”</p>
<p>“What kind of vacation is this…?” grunted Frank.</p>
<p>But as the children ate in silence, their eyes kept drifting toward the windows, where the fog continued its relentless dance, whispering promises no one dared to hear.</p>
<p>The twelve dings of the pendulum clock echoed through the silent house, each chime reverberating</p>
<p>faintly through the wooden walls. It was a sound that should have been comforting, a marker of time’s steady march, but tonight, it felt different. It carried a weight, as though each note was tugging at the threads of the night, loosening its grip on the ordinary.</p>
<p>Anna stirred in her bed, her small frame shifting under the quilt. Something had drawn her from her sleep, though she couldn’t tell what. The air in the room felt heavier, thicker, as if she were waking underwater.</p>
<p>Outside, the fog had come in slowly, almost unnoticed at first. It wasn’t unusual for the place; fog seemed to be a constant companion in this quiet village. Normally, it was light and smudged, a lazy veil that softened the edges of the world. But tonight, it was different.</p>
<p>This fog was thick, dense, and deliberate. It didn’t float aimlessly; it clung to the ground, pooling like a viscous liquid, heavier than it should be. It gathered in certain places, forming shapes that seemed almost solid before shifting and scattering. It was like the tendrils of smoke from a cigarette, pulled downward by an unseen force, slithering as though obeying gravity’s command.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just outside. The fog pressed against the windows, slipping through cracks, curling into the corners of the room. It hugged the trees and the garden, blotting out the familiar world. The difference was undeniable—it moved with a purpose, unnatural and unsettling.</p>
<p>“Anna...”</p>
<p>Her breath caught. There it was again, soft and tender, coaxing her, wrapping around her like an embrace.</p>
<p>“Anna, come here... It’s all right. You can walk, Anna. You can dance...”</p>
<p>The words struck something deep inside her, a longing she had buried long ago. Her lips quivered, her chest tightening as tears welled up in her eyes. She sat up slowly, her small frame trembling. Her wheelchair stood near the edge of her bed, its wheels glinting faintly in the pale light.</p>
<p>Her hands moved on their own, pulling the blanket aside and reaching for the chair. Her body felt weightless, guided by an unseen force. She didn’t hear the faint rustle of sheets from across the room.</p>
<p>Frank stirred, blinking blearily in the dark. “Anna?” he murmured, his voice heavy with sleep.</p>
<p>Anna didn’t respond. She was already sliding into her wheelchair, her movements almost mechanical.</p>
<p>“Anna, what are you doing?” Frank asked, his voice sharper now. He sat up, squinting through the dimness.</p>
<p>Anna’s back was to him, her head tilted slightly as if listening. “It’s... calling me,” she whispered, her voice distant and strange.</p>
<p>Frank frowned, swinging his legs over the side of his bed. “What’s calling you? Anna, stop being weird,” he said, irritation masking his growing concern.</p>
<p>She began to roll her chair toward the door, her hands moving with an eerie purpose. Frank stood, his feet cold against the wooden floor. “Hey, stop! You’re not supposed to leave the room!” Anna and frank were alone in the room, the room which is just beside the staircase.</p>
<p>He moved toward her, grabbing the back of her wheelchair. She froze for a moment, her head turning just enough for him to see her face. Her eyes were wide, glassy, and unfocused, her lips moving silently.</p>
<p>“Anna, wake up,” he said, shaking her shoulder.</p>
<p>But she didn’t. She jerked forward suddenly, and the chair tilted. Frank reached out to catch her, but she slipped free, tumbling to the floor.</p>
<p>“Anna!” he hissed, crouching beside her. “Are you okay?”</p>
<p>She didn’t answer. Instead, a strange giggle bubbled up from her lips, soft and unsettling. Frank recoiled, his stomach twisting.</p>
<p>“Anna, stop it,” he said, his voice cracking. “This isn’t funny.”</p>
<p>She began crawling, her small hands dragging her forward. Frank grabbed her ankle, his grip firm. “Where are you going? You can’t—”</p>
<p>Then he froze.</p>
<p>Something in the air shifted, a sensation he couldn’t describe. It wasn’t sound, exactly, but it felt like it—a weight pressing against his ears, vibrating in his chest. It pulled at him, subtle but relentless.</p>
<p>Frank shook his head, trying to clear it. “I’m not going. I’m not,” he muttered to himself, dragging Anna back toward her chair.</p>
<p>But his feet betrayed him. Step by step, he found himself moving, his grip on Anna loosening. His thoughts felt sluggish, his will fraying like old thread.</p>
<p>“Frank...” Anna’s voice was soft now, almost pleading. “It’s beautiful... I have to...”</p>
<p>“No,” he whispered, his voice hoarse. “No, you don’t. Stay here.”</p>
<p>But he wasn’t staying. His legs carried him forward, down the creaking stairs. His heart raced, panic blooming in his chest. He didn’t know what waited below—only that it wanted them both.</p>
<p>Anna and Frank slowly drifted forward, their minds wrapped in the thick embrace of the fog. It slithered through their thoughts, dulling reason, whispering secrets they couldn’t understand. Their feet moved, but not by will. Their bodies obeyed a pull beyond logic.</p>
<p>Anna stepped forward—her balance faltered. A misstep, a void beneath her foot. The staircase swallowed her whole. She tumbled downward, rolling over the steps, arms flailing, yet no sound escaped. The fog consumed it all, muffling cries that should have shattered the silence.</p>
<p>Frank didn’t think. He lunged after her, his breath strangled in his throat. The house warped around him. The walls stretched taller. The steps beneath him groaned like living things. He reached the ground floor. Anna lay still, a heap of tangled limbs, her breath shallow.</p>
<p>"Anna?" His voice barely pushed through the fog, sluggish and heavy.</p>
<p>Her eyes fluttered open. Glazed. Unfocused. "The house... it's awake."</p>
<p>Frank stiffened. A pulse in the air. The fog thickened, pressing against his skin like unseen hands. He turned</p>
<p>to the staircase behind him—only to find emptiness. The stairs had vanished into the void.</p>
<p>A heartbeat later, the walls convulsed. Portraits blinked, their painted eyes leaking shadows. The hallway twisted, stretching infinitely, the doors pulsing like breathing ribs. The fog coiled at their feet, tightening, whispering in voices not their own.</p>
<p>Frank tried to reach for Anna, but the fog slithered between them, cold and wet, seeping into his skin. He clenched his fingers—only air. He could barely think. The mist swam through his head, thick and intoxicating.</p>
<p>The mirror at the hall’s end rippled like disturbed water. Their reflections stood within—silent, still. Watching.</p>
<p>Anna’s reflection took a step forward. Anna did not.</p>
<p>Frank’s muscles locked. His own mirror image tilted its head, eyes empty pits of shifting fog.</p>
<p>Then, his reflection spoke.</p>
<p>"You are already here."</p>
<p>Frank pulled Anna up, her weight barely supported by his trembling arms. She clutched his shoulder, her breath ragged, her injured legs dragging limply as they moved through the endless, oppressive fog. The air pulsed around them, thick with whispers—half-heard voices from unseen mouths, calling, beckoning, pleading. The walls of the house stretched into the mist, warping and shifting as if the building itself was alive, breathing along with the fog.</p>
<p>Shapes flickered within the mist. Twisted figures loomed in the distance, their faces hollow yet familiar—people who had been here before, now part</p>
<p>of the fog. Some wept, others grinned with unsettling hunger. Anna’s grip on Frank tightened as her fingers twitched involuntarily, responding to the whispers that brushed against her mind like ghostly hands.</p>
<p>Then, they saw it—the Jesus Room. A single candle flickered on the altar, its golden glow clawing at the creeping fog, forcing it to retreat. The mist recoiled violently, writhing at the edges of the light, unable to cross into the room. Inside, the air was untouched, pristine, as if it belonged to a different world entirely.</p>
<p>They stepped inside. The moment they crossed the threshold, an invisible force pressed against their backs, desperate to keep them from leaving the fog’s grasp. The whispers screeched in protest, a cacophony of anguished wails that crashed against the flickering barrier of candlelight.</p>
<p>"Join us..."</p>
<p>"The light must go out..."</p>
<p>"You are not alone... let us in..."</p>
<p>The fog warped again. Faces took form—figures from their past, people lost to the house long before them. The dead stood at the edges of the light, their features distorted with longing, their hands stretching forward, trembling just beyond the reach of the glow.</p>
<p>Anna’s body quaked. She could barely crawl, her limbs burning with exhaustion, but her mind—her mind was drowning in the illusion. The figures weren’t strangers. She knew them. Their voices were real. Their sorrow was real.</p>
<p>The room felt smaller, like the walls were pressing in. The fog coiled at the edges of the candlelight,</p>
<p>writhing, testing its limits. Shadows slithered through the mist, shifting, whispering, watching.</p>
<p>Anna clung to Frank’s arm, her breath shallow, her fingers cold against his skin. Her lips trembled. “Frank, don’t listen,” she whispered. “We have to stay here. We have to keep the light.”</p>
<p>Frank barely heard her. The fog pulsed against his mind, warping his senses. The room was colder now, the air pressing in on his chest.</p>
<p>Then—he heard her voice.</p>
<p>"Frank… help me."</p>
<p>His head snapped toward Anna, but she wasn’t speaking. Her lips were still, her eyes wide with fear.</p>
<p>"Frank, please… you promised you’d never leave me."</p>
<p>It was her voice. But not from her. It was coming from the fog.</p>
<p>He felt something warm—fingers, soft and delicate, brushing against his cheek. Anna’s fingers. No—not Anna’s. The fog twisted reality, wrapping around his memories, threading itself into his past.</p>
<p>"Frank, if you love me… let me in."</p>
<p>His breath hitched. The mist trembled, waiting. The candle burned low. The wick flickered, dancing, fighting.</p>
<p>His hand rose. Trembling fingers reached for the flame.</p>
<p>Anna saw it—saw his hesitation, the flicker of doubt in his eyes. She screamed.</p>
<p>“FRANK, NO—!”</p>
<p>His fingers closed.</p>
<p>The candle went out.</p>
<p>The room collapsed into blackness.</p>
<p>The walls groaned, twisting unnaturally as the floor buckled beneath them. The fog surged inward with a deafening roar, no longer restrained, crashing over them like a tidal wave. The whispers turned to laughter—mocking, victorious, ravenous.</p>
<p>Then—Anna screamed.</p>
<p>Something had her. A hand—not flesh, not bone, but something wrong. A shadowy claw, slick with shifting mist, wrapped around her ankle and yanked.</p>
<p>She jerked violently, her body slamming onto the wooden floor.</p>
<p>Her fingers latched onto the planks, digging in, clawing desperately. Her nails splintered, cracked, peeled back, exposing raw, bloody flesh. But the force was too strong.</p>

<p>Frank tightened his grip until his arms burned. But the fog wasn’t pulling her.</p>
<p>It was taking her.</p>
<p>Anna thrashed, legs kicking wildly, her ruined nails carving deep, jagged gashes into the wood. The sound of her fingertips splitting, tearing filled the air.</p>
<p>A final, brutal wrench.</p>
<p>Her body ripped from his grasp.</p>
<p>She was yanked backward into the swirling abyss, her form swallowed whole by the black mist.</p>
<p>A last, strangled scream—then silence.</p>
<p>Frank collapsed onto the floor, gasping. His trembling hands, now sticky with her blood, clutched nothing but empty air.</p>
<p>The whispers stopped.</p>
<p>The house exhaled.</p>
<p>Then—Anna’s voice. Soft. Distant. Wrong.</p>
