          <hr>
        <p>
            There are some journeys where you know you’re moving, and then there are the ones where
            you realize you’ve changed. <br>
            It was just another college evening. I was on the bus home with my brother-in-vision,<b> Prudhvi B.</b>
            Two hours stretched before us like usual. The hum of the engine. Sleepy heads. Bored students.
            But our minds weren’t quiet. <br>
            We were talking about purpose, about energy, about the kind of passion we’d seen in our peers.
            But more than anything, we were talking about clubs.
        </p>
          
        <p>
            I had a friend from<b> IIT Madras,</b> and we both had a long chat about the life there at IIT ... it
            wasn’t just technical. it was alive. Lit up by communities, clubs, creativity, debates, coding,
            photography, music, writing. A whole universe. <br>
            We asked ourselves a simple question:
            <b> Why not us? Why not in Lendi?</b>
        </p>
        <h5> The Spark </h5>
        <p>
            
            We felt it’s a very big story and maybe, a dream, a dream of first years starting clubs in the
            college and etching their names un-shaken! I remember listening to one of the videos of
            <b> Shraddha Kaapra (From Apna College) </b>asking students of latter years in colleges to take such
            initiatives and become unforgotten names of college. But it still sounded too <strong>“Astronomical”</strong>
            for reality.
        </p>
          
        
            <h5>The First Yes That Mattered <br></h5>
        <p>
            Back on campus, we couldn’t hold it in. We went to our friend <b> Dhanush Kumar</b>, someone we
            always saw as a powerhouse. Turns out, he was waiting for something like this too. He didn’t
            just agree, he brought energy and vision that, in future, made him the perfect <b>President of
            Lendi Radio Club.</b> But we needed someone who could walk us into rooms that students
            couldn’t access. Someone who saw more than marks and metrics. So, we went to the person we
            now call the architect of this movement — <b style="font-size: larger; color:#0d6dfd;">Dr. T. Hari Babu sir</b>, or as we love to call him, Hari
            Sir.
        </p>
          
          <h5> The Giant Who Sat with Us like a Saint <br></h5>
        <p>
            There are men who walk fast. Then there are those who help others rise and walk with them.
            Hari Sir is the second kind. He’s more than our<b> Vice Principal (Academics).</b> He is a <b>literary
            stalwart</b>, an <b>NSS leader</b>, a <b>cultural curator</b>, a man of <b>three decades</b> of service who could quote
            Shakespeare and Kabir with the same warmth.
        </p>
          <h6>
            <b style="color: #0d6dfd;"> <i>"Verses dance at his graceful command!" (I always Quote to my fellow mates whenever I see him)</i></b>
          </h6>
        <p>
            We sat in front of him with our trembling voices and starry eyes and told him our dream.
            And he smiled. That kind of smile that said, <br>
            <i style="color: #0d6dfd;">"You’re not the first to dream this. But maybe you’ll be the first to finish it." </i><br>
            He told us about <b>SAC—Student Activity Centre.</b> A body that once housed multiple clubs but had
            gone dormant. He didn’t hesitate. He stood with us. In every way. He helped plan structures,
            assign faculty mentors, motivate students, and revive a dormant dream. Even when students
            didn’t show up. Even when we were morally rock bottom, he stood by us. Financially.
            Logistically. Spiritually.
        </p>
        <p>
            A man whose time is waited for across the state gave us hours without flinching. Yes... literally.
            One day, you wouldn’t believe how shocked I was, to know his photo was there in the portal of
            British Council’s English page...!
        </p>
          
          <h5> Foundations: Brick by Brick, Soul by Soul <br> </h5>
        <p>
            Soon, we met <b>Principal Dr. V.V. Rama Reddy Sir.</b> we got official recognition. From there began
            the real test, not of formality, but of consistency. <br>
            We started writing drafts, taking photographs, doing dry runs, hosting tiny sessions anything to
            ignite curiosity. And slowly, the clubs began to breathe. <br>
            • I became <b>Interim President of Lendi Write Club. </b><br>
            • <b>Dhanush Kumar led Lendi Radio Club</b> with strength and spontaneity. <br>
            • Cultural Club and Photography Club found rhythm with mentors and fresh minds. <br>
        </p>
          
          <h5> The Story of Lendi Write Club <br></h5>
        <p>
            LWC had the slowest start—but the strongest soul. We began with nothing—just ideas and a
            few voices. <br>
            But then came the mentors: <br>
            • <b>Prof. Sravani Rama ma’am </b>– a lighthouse of literature. <br>
            • <b>Prof. Revathi G ma’am</b>– full of quiet wisdom. <br>
            •<b> Prof. Raja Narasimha N sir</b>– always precise, always present. <br>
            With them, we built a club that didn't shout but spoke. Spoke deeply. <br>
            We released sample newsletters, ran weekly meets, and watched the seeds slowly sprout.
        </p>
          
          <h5> Eventually, a strong core formed: <br></h5>
        <p>
            • <b>Ardhahakula Jyothsna</b>, a Youth Parliamentarian, became <b>President</b>. <br>
            • I Assumed reins as The <b>Editor-in-Chief</b>, where I felt most alive. <br>
            • <b>J. Koushik became VP</b>—reliable, rooted. <br>
            • <b>Prudhvi B</b>, of course, became our<b> Publishing Lead</b>.<br>
            • <b>Hiran Mavi </b>turned our vision into visuals as <b>Design Lead</b>.<br>
            • <b>Parthiv</b>, quiet and curious, led <b>Tech.</b> <br>
            • And <b>Divya M</b>, a brilliant writer from my own class, emerged as one of our finest pens.<br>
        </p>
          
          <h5>
            <b>A Day to Remember: 15th May 2025</b> <br>
          </h5>
        <p>
            On this golden date, we launched the<b> first official LWC newsletter.</b><br>
            Printed. Sharp. Real. Ours. We walked with it to<b> Principal Rama Reddy Sir and to Hari Sir</b>, and
            we presented it like a medal of honor. To all the respected <b>HoDs </b>and faculty mentors who
            helped shape it, it was more than a publication. It was proof. <br>
            Proof that a spark in a bus can light a bonfire in a campus. <br>
        </p>
          
        <p>
            More Than Clubs—We Built Character <br>
            This wasn’t just about content or activities. <br>
            It was about change. <br>
            Now, students had platforms. Shy kids found voices. Talented ones found stages. Writers found
            readers. Photographers found meaning. Speakers found listeners. <br>
            Even faculty members started looking forward to our work. Our culture began to shift. <br>
            SAC wasn’t just reactivated. It was reborn.
        </p>
          
          <h5> Final Words: This Is Legacy <br></h5>
        <p>
            Looking back, I don’t remember every detail. But I remember every emotion. <br>
            That bus ride didn’t just take us home, it led us to our purpose. <br>
            This is not a story about me. <br>
            Not even just about Prudhvi, Dhanush, or our amazing teams. <br>
            This is a story of what happens when students are trusted. <br>
            When ideas are not laughed at, but lifted. <br>
            When education includes expression, not just examination. <br>
            And that’s what we created. <br>
            Not four clubs. <br>
            But a culture. <br>
            One that will live long after we’ve passed the torch. <br>
        </p>
